# F1 2021 Telemetry

The Codemasters F1 game series includes a feature to output telemetry info from the game in real time. 
This telemetry can be used as input for other programs, such as controllers, statistics apps, telemetry displays like the ones
you can see during real F1 races.

This library implements a decoder for the F1 2021 UDP packets.

## Packet types

Each piece of information about the race is sent as a different packet type, this library implements the following types.
All data is encoded in Little Endian format.

### Packet ID

The packet IDs are as follows:

| Packet Name          | Value | Description                                                                      |
| -------------------- | ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Motion               | 0     | Contains all motion data for player’s car – only sent while player is in control |
| Session              | 1     | Data about the session – track, time left                                        |
| Lap Data             | 2     | Data about all the lap times of cars in the session                              |

| Participants         | 4     | List of participants in the session, mostly relevant for multiplayer             |
| Car Setups           | 5     | Packet detailing car setups for cars in the race                                 |
| Car Telemetry        | 6     | Telemetry data for all cars                                                      |
| Car Status           | 7     | Status data for all cars                                                         |

### Packet header

Size: 24 bytes

```c
struct PacketHeader

### Event packets

Event packets contain data for events happening during the race. They don't have a set rate, and will 
only be sent as needed.

                                               // May vary depending on game mode
    uint8               m_mfdPanelIndexSecondaryPlayer;   // See above
    int8                m_suggestedGear;       // Suggested gear for the player (1-8)
                                               // 0 if no gear suggested
